Click on the arrow to download the notebook to your local machine. Then use the Jupyter notebook file utility to import the notebooks into your environment. Python Libraries Many of the notebooks below rely on Python libraries to be installed. If you are creating your own Jupyter notebook environment, please refer to the Running Notebooks on an External Server notebook to load the proper libraries. Several of the notebooks use the Presto Magic commands to run SQL against the server. Make sure you have a copy of the Presto notebook in your environment in order for the SQL commands to work. Overview Notebooks Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, select this document to learn about the basics of navigating within a notebook. Download Table of Contents This notebook contains a table of contents that includes links to all of the notebooks found in this repository. Use this notebook as a convenient way of selecting which notebook you want to work with. Download Images Several notebooks refer to images found in the images directory. This link will download a zip file that contains all of the images that are references by the notebooks. Unzip the file and make sure that it is placed into a directory called images in the directory where the Jupyter notebooks are found. Download Administration Watsonx.data Credentials All the credentials required to connect to the watsonx.data services can be found in this notebook. The notebook also includes links for download the Presto certificate files. Download User Administration The watsonx.data developer edition does not provide a way of adding new users through the UI. The following notebook provides a series of commands that allows for the creation and deletion of users in the system. Download Presto SQL Presto Magic Commands Presto Magic commands make it easy to run SQL in cells in your Jupyter Notebook as is, without any Python code. This notebook shows how to enable this feature for watsonx.data and provides some examples of its use. Download Introduction to Presto SQL Watsonx.data is based on open source PrestoDB, a distributed query engine that enables querying data stored in open file formats using open table formats for optimization or performance. This notebook will examine some of the SQL features that are available in watsonx.data. Download Presto Federation If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, select this document to learn about the basics of navigating within a notebook. Download Application Access to watsonx.data Python with watsonx.data This notebook will connect to watsonx.data using Python code and the prestodb library. The DBAPI interface is used to communicate to the watsonx.data Presto server. Download Pandas Dataframes with watsonx.data Pandas dataframes are commonly used in Jupyter notebooks to analyze data. This code will connect to watsonx.data using a Pandas dataframe and display some data from an existing table that was created in Presto. Note that the certificate required for this notebook is provided in the environment. Download Accessing watsonx.data with Spark This notebook demonstrates how Spark can connect to watsonx.data and manipulate the data. This system has a local Spark engine that will be used to access watsonx.data. This is a minimally configured Spark engine, but is sufficient to demonstrate the steps needed to connect to watsonx.data and access the data that resides in the catalogs. Download Converting CSV files to Parquet This notebook demonstrates how to convert a CSV file into Parquet Format. Download Create a Kafka Service Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. It processes streams of events with joins, aggregations, filters, transformations, and more, using event-time and exactly-once processing. The notebooks below are used to create a Kafka service and demonstrate the connectivity with watsonx.data. Download RESTful Support Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the internet. Presto provides provides RESTful services which are explored in the following notebook. Download Connecting to Other Databases Connecting to Db2 This notebook demonstrates connecting to the local Db2 server using Jupyter notebooks. Download Connecting to PostgreSQL This notebook demonstrates connecting to the local PostgreSQL server using Jupyter notebooks. Download Connecting to MySQL This notebook demonstrates connecting to the local MySQL server using Jupyter notebooks. Download Milvus Vector Database Connecting to Milvus This notebook demonstrates connecting to the local Milvus vector database server using a Jupyter notebook. Download Milvus Example Watsonx is IBM's platform committed to injecting generative AI into services that span across customer's data lifecycle. This notebook focusses on the use of watsonx.data as a data repository that is used to feed data into the Milvus vector database. Output from a Milvus query can then be used to generate a prompt into watsonx.ai. Download Milvus Attu Console The Milvus vector database does not ship with a console in watsonx.data. If you want to use the supported console you will need to use this notebook to start up the Attu console. Download Support Notebooks Running Notebooks on an External Server The Jupyter notebooks found in the watsonx.data server can be hosted on an external server. This notebook will provide details of what code needs to be installed to run the examples in another server. Download Db2 Magic Source Code This notebook contains the Db2 magic code that is used in the Db2 example notebook. Download this notebook (db2.ipynb) and use the %run db2.ipynb command to enable the magic commands in your code. This provides an easy to use interface to access Db2 with the %sql command in your notebook. Download Presto Magic Source Code This notebook contains the Presto magic code that is used in many of the notebooks in this list. Download this notebook (presto.ipynb) and use the %run presto.ipynb command to enable the magic commands in your code. This provides an easy to use interface to access Presto with the %sql command in your notebook.
